## How It Works  

1. **Input or Trigger** — The user specifies artist names, genres, or target profiles within the Appilot dashboard.  
2. **Core Logic** — The system uses Appium or UIAutomator to open Spotify, search for each artist, and tap the “Follow” button.  
3. **Output or Action** — Each artist gets followed on Spotify; progress and logs are recorded in the dashboard.  
4. **Error Handling** — Includes auto-retry, app relaunch, and session timeout logic to maintain stability.  
5. **Post-Processing** — Generates completion reports showing which artists were successfully followed.
